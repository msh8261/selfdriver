# selfdrive car
## Project Description <br>
by applying lane line detection (Use Computer Vision techniques via OpenCV to identify lane lines) and PID controller to control the steering_angle to drive smoother. 
<br>

## Simulator
the Udacity simulator "https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim" is used to take images in the movement of the car.

## Deep learning Model 
a CNN neural networks is trained based on data to adjust the steering angle.

## Result
the prformance of pid controller is recorded from simulator.
